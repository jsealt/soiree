## Context and Problem Statement

### Why are we here?

#### Early Stories

- As a metaverse user, I want to access my shit so that I may use my shit when and where I want to use my shit (within reason).
- As a metaverse user, I need to own my data so that I don't have to ask permission for my shit.
  - We don't want to have to ask permission to wear our shit when we go to a virtual picnic.
- As a metaverse creator, I want my shit to be helpful.
- As a metaverse creator, I want to contribute my shit to the overall pile of shit.
As a metaverse creator, I would benefit from our users being able to take inventory from our world with them into other worlds and bring inventory from other worlds into our world.
- Humbletim has a phone in their inventory and wants to pull the phone out of their inventory to use it.
- I have made plans with my friend to have a nice VR picnic, and I'd like to have a VR picnic with some stuff I brought and some stuff they brought.
  - This is a viable use case of the OMI GLTF proposal.

"Open Inventory doesn't make sense unless users can own, retrieve, and leverage their inventory. (it has to work). Having operating soverignty allows us to innovate in unanticipated ways."

#### Personas: Whom are we serving?

Whom are the key stakeholders involved with adopting our proposal and implementing these inventory functions?

1.  **End users:**
    - The Active User: People who visit worlds regularly
    - The Tourist: casual or new visitors to the ecosystem
    - The First timer: First-time user experiencers (FTUX)
2.  **The Creators:** The people who create worlds or characters on platforms.
3.  **The Platform / Host:** The governing body, the physical laws of the selected universe. (Hubs, VRChat, Fortnite)
4.  **The Tools:** any Tool that helps the creators get their job done.
5.  **The Shopkeeper:** Anyone providing a service for the metaverse. (can be free or paid)

#### What do we hope to accomplish?

- A baseline for managing and accessing personal inventory
- Users own their data
- Showcase the power of collaboration?
- Create an ecosystem alternative. The anti-platform

## Describe the proposed option and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation

Plan a **Soiree:** a party or gathering, typically in a _private_ house, for conversation or music.

- If we start with npm, one could take that and make it work for Godot or something else
- (one of us could even be in the browse)
- A signalling server could act as copper wire (like a bit of reflector dish that you launch as a satellite above the internet, to make introductions for us. It is a leaky point with a slippery slope where all of a sudden, people want to extend it with rooms. Instead, it just needs to make an introduction, and then the rest happens locally)

We can go to the private chat in discord paste our ssh instead of signalling server (way more secure)

We have options.

## Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudo-code, mock-ups, or diagrams

Today we met to start our team working agreement. We left off at Mission.

### Our next steps:

- Finish the team working agreement
- LDJ (lightning decision jam)

## Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- [e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, …]

## Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- [e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, …]

[this section can be repeated for each option if more than one option is open for consideration]

## Option graveyard: <!-- same as above -->

- Option: <!-- [List the proposed options no longer open for consideration.] -->
- Rejection Reason: <!-- [List the reasons for the rejection: (the Bad traits)] -->

## If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?

Platforms are not trivial to code.

## Is there a reason why this should be core and done by us?

We need to care about this more than everyone else.
